                    Hello everyone. I'm Elizabeth, (or Liz for short).I'm an UI/UX designer. Before becoming a UI/UX Designer I was in the Early Childhood education profession, in other words I taught children under the age of five. I decide to leave that field because I felt I couldn't grow and I needed a new challenge. Even though they seem different their are some similarity traits between an Early Childhood educator and UI/UX design. Some of them including working with a team which include working with people with a verity of background, their is also have problem solving skills for example in a early childhood setting it would be solving a behavior issues or a social conflict, while in software development it trying to solve a issues in the code to make it work. Then their also being able to break down a problems into more manageable steps. The reason I choose software development when  deciding to switch career is because I enjoy the feeling of creating something new and saying "I did that" after facing a difficult task or issues in the code.
